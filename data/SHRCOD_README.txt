All CSVs are named for the code type have two columns: code,description

Note that:

1. AgeOfVictimOffender code lists 00-99 as "age of victim/offender". I add rows 1,1;...99,99. Not sure if that's what you would want for lookup.

2. Circumstances has two codes (80, 81) that come with subcodes (A-G). I just combined the codes and included all combinations (e.g. 80A).
